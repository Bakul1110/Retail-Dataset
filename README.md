# Retail-Dataset

In this project I will be working on the Reatil dataset in which we will try to find out the distribution of sales according to different different variables. Here we will also try to analyze that what are the factors that are affecting our sales or will find out some which may be beneficial for the sales. After analysing all this we will come up with a solution also on how to promote our sales keeping in mind all the factors we have analyzed.

1).Checking the structure of dataset and looking for missing values.

First of all we have to look at the structure of our dataset that what is it actually and how do we deal with it. Then we will look for the missing values if present followed by the errenous values.

2).Checking the presence of outliers and errenous values.

We will then check different variables for the presence of outliers.

3).Data cleaning

After checking them all we will clean the dataset and onc cleaned we are good to go for further analysis.

4). Univariate analysis

As the name suggests in this step we have to look for the distribution of each variable. This step is crucial to see whether the variables are normally distributed or not. If not then we will go for transformation of the data because in order to deploy our ML model for prediction, it is important to ensure the normalization of features. reason : Machine learning algorithms tend to perform better or converge faster when the different features (variables) are on a smaller scale. Therefore it is common practice to normalize the data before training machine learning models on it. Normalization also makes the training process less sensitive to the scale of the features.

5). Bivariate analysis

After analyzing distribution of each variable now we will look at the relation between different variables. Also will observe the correlation between different numerical variables and their effect on our target variable.
